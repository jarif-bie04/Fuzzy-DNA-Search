Hello, everyone. I am Jarif Ayman.
Welcome to our Bioinformatics Engineering course CSM- 1124: Structured Programming Language’s project, supervised by Dr. Machbah Uddin.
This is my first project in level-1, semester-1 where I attempted to integrate my understanding of biology with structured programming principles.
My project is BioFuzzAnalyzer which is basically Fuzzy Search DNA.
Fuzzy Search DNA is the process of finding DNA sequences that approximately match a given query sequence, allowing for differences such as matches, mismatches, insertions or deletions.
It is critically needed in primer design, mutation screening and comparative genomics while prioritizing reproducibility through its open-source implementation.
I have used a Customized Needleman-Wunsh Algorithm and took inspiration from SMS2 bioinformatics toolkit.
Special thanks to my mentor, Anik Howlader.
